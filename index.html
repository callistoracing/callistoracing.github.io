    <h2>Sponsorships</h2>
    <p>By partnering with companies, we can expand our opportunities and accomplish even more as a team. For example, we spend our sponsorship money on uniform clothing for our competitions. This makes us look put together and professional, helping us stand out from other teams. The money also goes toward transport costs, entry fees, material costs, and other vital expenses that enable us to compete at our best. Our relationship with our sponsors is mutually beneficial; in return for sponsoring us, companies receive promotion via our Instagram, as well as their logo on our car and all team clothing. You can find out more about our sponsors below.</p>
